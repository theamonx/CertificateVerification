# Certificate Verification
It's a page I have made to verify the internship certificate (FRONT END ONLY). It was a Project Assignment given by [Internpluss](https://www.internpluss.com/) as part of their evaluation process and I had to complete it in 24 hours time limit and I did it. Late submissions were allowded, the assignment was primarily to assess our speed and time management skills.
